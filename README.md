 GOLVE
Game Of Life, Virus Edition

What is GOL-VE?
Game Of Life, Virus Edition - the traditional Game Of Life game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) 
with a virus twist: starting a pre-defined generation, a virus spreads! the horror!! and in the new order, these are the rules:
1. Any dead cell with a single live neighbor lives on to the next generation.
2. Any live cell with no horizontal or vertical live neighbors dies.

Why is GOL-VE useful:
It's a nice excersize and also a fun game. who needs Fortnite.

How users can get started with the GOLVE:
execute main with the following args - width, height, infect-after, max-generations, seed, interval
width and height of the seed universe to start from
infect-after - at which generation you wish the horrible virus to spread
max-generation - how many generations you want the game to run
seed - a flat representation of the seed universe
interval - what's the interval [sec] you wish between 2 generations
example: 3 3 3 10 "0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1" 1
